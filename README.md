# Voting_Management_System_Java_OOPs_Based
Language used : Java - Object Oriented Programming System - OOPs

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent broad categories, like Car or Dog that share attributes. These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, like color, but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.

Classes can also contain functions, called methods available only to objects of that type. These functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object.

Classes and object based Solution for Voting Management Sublevel

Voting management can be classfied into three main levels : 
1. Voter & votecard validation -- Class & Object
2. Voting room and machine assignment --  Class
3. Voting -- Method

After this three levels we will need to find total votes casted , number of machine used , area from which maximum voting is happened.
The particular java program will work on this main three levels as well as it will calculate above parameters.

### Classes can be categorized as :   
1. Voter Class
2. Machine Class
3. Main class

### Objects with data are : 
1. Voter object - containing voterId,voterName,voterArea,isVoted,boothId
2. Machine object - containing machineId, roomNumber, personInCharge;

### Methods are :
1. Main Method - public static void main(String[] bk)   for object initializations and method calling.
2. Method 1 : howManyVoteCasted_Total_Casted_Vote(voter,machine.getMachineId());   To find total numbers of casted votes.
3. Method 2 : areaWiseCastedVoteAnalysis(voter);  To find area wise contribuition in votes.
